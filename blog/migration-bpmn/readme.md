### Migration of a BPMN process

In this Spring Boot (v2.1.6.RELEASE) project we migrate a Flowable BPMN process with Flowable OSS (v6.4.1). The use case is a simple restaurant reservation process.


old process model:

![process_v1](process_v1.png "Restaurant Reservation Process v1")

new process model:

![process_v4](process_v4.png "Restaurant Reservation Process v4")
